## (Optional) Step 4: Configure S/4HANA

## Troubleshooting

### SAP Build Apps with a SAML Identity Provider

SAP Build Apps requires an SAP Identity Authentication Service tenant connected via OpenID Connect (OIDC) to the SAP BTP subaccount using the **Establish Trust** functionality.

### IAS tenant not appearing under Establish Trust

The SAP Identitiy Authentication Service Tenant only appears under **Establish Trust** when both is assigned to the same customer id.
